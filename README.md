This is the repo for my blog website.

## Environment
To set up hexo environment, use the commands following:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:yongcongwang/blog.git &&
cd blog &&
bash script/set_environment.sh
```
This will install hexo and other necessary files.

## Usage
The script `deploy.sh` will push both src files and static website to github.
