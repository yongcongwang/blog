## Greedy Algorithm
Greedy Algorithms works in phases. In each phase, a decision is made that appears to be good, without regard for future consequences. Generally, this means that some *local optimum* is chosen. This "take what you can get now" strategy is the source of the name for this class of algorithms. When the algorithm terminates, we hope that the *local optimum* is equal to the *global optimum*. If this is the case, then the algorithm is correct; otherwise, the algorithm has produced a suboptimal solution. If the absolute best answer is not required, then the simple greedy algorithms are sometimes used to generate approximate answers, rather than using the more complicated algorithms generally required to generate an exact answer.
